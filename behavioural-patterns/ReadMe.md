Behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify and define common communication patterns among objects, specifying how they interact and distribute responsibilities between them. These patterns focus on the interactions between cooperating objects and are concerned with algorithms and the assignment of responsibilities.

Behavioral patterns differ from creational patterns (which deal with object creation) and structural patterns (which deal with object composition and relationships). Instead, they concentrate on how objects collaborate, pass messages, and distribute tasks among themselves.

There are 12 behavioral design patterns
1.Chain of Responsibility- Passes a request along a chain of objects, where each object decides whether to process it or pass it to the next handler.
2.Command- Encapsulates a request as a stand-alone object containing all information needed to perform an action, enabling delayed execution and undoable operations.
3.Interpreter- Provides a way to include language elements in a program.
4.Iterator- Allows sequential access to elements of a collection without exposing its underlying representation.
5.Mediator- Reduces chaotic dependencies by restricting direct communication between objects and forcing them to collaborate only through a mediator.
6.Memento- Captures and allows restoration of an object's previous state without revealing implementation details.
7.Observer- Defines a one-to-many dependency where changes in one object automatically notify and update all dependent objects.
8.State- Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, making it appear as if it changed its class at runtime.
9.Strategy- Encapsulates different algorithms within a class, allowing selection and switching between them at runtime based on client input.
10.Template Method- Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, allowing subclasses to redefine specific steps without changing the overall structure.
11.Visitor- Enables defining new operations on objects without modifying their classes.
12.Blackboard- Provides a computational framework for systems that integrate specialized modules and implement complex control strategies.
