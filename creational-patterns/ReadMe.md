Creational Patterns – How objects are created
They abstract the instantiation process and help make your system independent of how its objects are created.

Singleton – Ensure a class has only one instance.

Factory Method – Delegate object creation to subclasses.

Abstract Factory – Create families of related objects.

Builder – Construct complex objects step-by-step.

Prototype – Clone existing objects instead of creating new ones.
