Structural design patterns are design blueprints that define how different objects and classes are combined
together to form larger structures while maintaining flexibility and scalability. These patterns focus on 
simplifying relationships between entities by composing objects and classes in ways that allow new functionalities
to emerge without modifying existing code.

Structural design patterns help developers achieve three key goals: increased flexibility through decoupled components, improved scalability by enabling dynamic system architectures, and enhanced efficiency by managing memory effectively.
They allow both class hierarchies and object relationships to evolve independently while remaining interconnected.

The Seven Structural Design Patterns
1. Adapter Pattern
2. Bridge Pattern
3. Composite Pattern
4. Decorator Pattern
5. Facade Pattern
6. Flyweight Pattern
7. Proxy Pattern
